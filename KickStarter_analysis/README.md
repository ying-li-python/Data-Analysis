# Analyze Kickstarter campaigns using Excel

Let's try to predict the trends by which Kickstart campaigns are likely to suceed. This folder contains data analysis of Kickstarter campaigns using conditional formatting and use of pivot tables to gather certain data.

## Analysis 
- Categories such as music and theater tend to have higher percentage of “successful” campaigns. Conversely, categories such as food, technology, and games have lower percentages of “success” with higher percentage of both “failed” and “canceled” campaigns. This data suggests that donaters prefer to endorse music and theatre campaigns.
- According to the data, high numbers of “successful” sub-categories with zero numbers of failed and canceled campaigns include classical music, documentary, electronic music, hardware, nonfiction, rock, TV, tabletop games. This suggests that donaters have a strong preference towards these sub-categories as compared to the other sub-categories that have failed or were canceled or both.
- Results from the time-series line plot show that peak of “successful” campaigns occurs at May whereas peak of “failed” campaigns occur during October (presumably due to the holidays). “Canceled” campaigns remains to be consistent throughout the year, with slight peaks at July and November. Collectively, these data suggest that donaters are likely to endorse campaigns when it is not during the holiday season (Oct-Dec) and not during summertime (June-Aug) when people are away on vacation.
