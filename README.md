# Data analysis with Excel  

Data stored in Excel is massive and data parsing can be time-consuming, if done by hand. Here are two ways to look at data trends by conditional formating in Excel and creating scripts in Visual Basic. 

## Resources
* Data provided by UC Berkeley's Data Analysis and Visualization

## Methods 
* Excel (Pivot tables) and Visual Basic 
  
## Kickstarter campaign trends 

Let's try to predict the trends by which Kickstart campaigns are likely to suceed using Excel. This folder contains data analysis of Kickstarter campaigns using conditional formatting and use of pivot tables, as shown in a dashboard.

## Wall Street Stock trends 

How is the stock market trends for each ticker in 2014, 2015, and 2016? This folder contains a VBA script that reads stock market values for multiple years (2014, 2015, and 2016) and creates a summary table for each ticker including Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume. Additional table shows the greatest % increase and % decrease for that year. 


Below is an example result for the 2014 year.
